Frederick Douglass said that while he had lived for black people, John Brown had died for them. A later black reformer, W. E. B. Du Bois, called Brown the white American who had “come nearest to touching the real souls of black folk.” Du Bois was right. Unlike nearly all other Americans of his era, John Brown did not have a shred of racism. He had long lived among African-Americans, trying to help them make a living, and he wanted blacks to be quickly integrated into American society. When Brown was told he could have a clergyman to accompany him to the gallows, he refused, saying he would be more honored to go with a slave woman and her children."

E. B. Du Bois: Biography of a Race, 1868-1919"" (Henry Holt & Company, New York, $35), a 735-page tome, described by Dr. Lewis in his preface as a project that ""often rendered me unaware of the routine of daily life."" Du Bois died in 1963 at the age of 95, and the research involved travel over three continents, inquiry into 28 archives and 99 library collections and interviews with more than 150 people. ""And alas,"" Dr. Lewis said recently, ""all this for what it turns out is only volume one."" But ""Du Bois"" -- a candidate for the National Book Award in nonfiction -- is a powerfully thorough book that because its subject was such a extraordinary leader, so central to the political controversies around him, it compels a reappraisal of the post-Civil War era. Du Bois is perhaps best known in the civil rights movement for his insistence on full equality for his fellow blacks, as opposed to the accommodative policies of Booker T. Washington. But Dr. Lewis's book reveals much more about Du Bois as political strategist. In 1911, for example, when Woodrow Wilson, then Governor of New Jersey, prepared to enter the Presidential race, he asked Du Bois to influence blacks to depart from their traditional Republican stance and vote Democratic. After Wilson won with a larger-than-expected vote and segregationist politics continued, Du Bois retaliated with searing anti-Wilson editorials in The Crisis, the magazine of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People."

He was given the house for his 60th birthday by friends, who included Clarence Darrow, the lawyer.

Du Bois’s groundbreaking “Black Reconstruction in America: An Essay Toward a History of the Part which Black Folk Played in the Attempt to Reconstruct Democracy in America, 1860-1880.” There is no direct connection between the book’s republication and the wave of educational gag orders around race and racism. Nonetheless, there is something fortuitous in how Du Bois, writing from 1935, comments on and critiques the politics of history in 2022. The concluding chapter of “Black Reconstruction,” “The Propaganda of History,” is a polemical essay on the uses and abuses of historical narrative as well as a heated attack on the mainstream of American history writing as it existed in the 1920s and ’30s, when Du Bois’s book was conceived, researched and written. Du Bois excoriates those historians for acting less as “scientists” in search of something like objective truth and more as propagandists for a social and economic order of segregation, violence and exploitation:"

The protagonist goes deaf and, unable to hear the music that has sustained him, tries to recapture it with his pen. The novel was never published. While a Du Bois Fellow, West was married and had a son, Clifton, supporting his family by teaching. (That marriage and a later one both ended in divorce.) ""The first thing I ever taught was a class on 'Antigone,' in which a student thought I was a janitor and asked me to get more chairs.

''Du Bois still has great influence on us,'' Ghana's Foreign Minister, Obed Asamoah, said in an interview here. Ghana's Pan-Africanist foreign policy was evident last October, when the Government declared five days of mourning in honor of Samora M. Machel, the Mozambique leader who was killed in a plane crash in South Africa. Seeds of African Independence In the first half of this century, Du Bois organized five Pan-African congresses, meetings that planted the seeds for the crop of independent nations that sprang up in Africa in the 1960's. Almost a quarter of a century after Du Bois's death, the Pan-Africanist outlook can be seen in the joint pressure mounted by Africans and black Americans to win majority rule for South-West African, known as Namibia, and South Africa. Pan-Africanists have also encountered setbacks. For now, Du Bois's ideal of a United States of Africa seems far out of reach. One symbol of modern Africa's nationalist rivalries was Nigeria's abrupt expulsion - enforced with pistols and whips - of a million illegal workers from Ghana in 1983. The center, which is gathering his books, papers and other memorabilia, is in his bungalow on a quiet residential street here. The one-story Du Bois house has overhanging eaves to block the afternoon sun, ceiling fans to cool the interior and holes cut in closets to reduce mildew."

But the street-lit debate touches deeper historical roots, reviving decades-old
                                arguments in black literary circles about the mandate to uplift the race and present wholesome images of African-Americans. In 1928, W. E. B. Du Bois slammed the “licentiousness” of “

And if that was to be the case, “if the record of human action is going to be set down with that accuracy and faithfulness of detail which will allow its use as a measuring rod and guidepost for the future of nations,” then in his view, “there must be set some standards of ethics in research and interpretation.” Du Bois’s view was that, when it came to Reconstruction and the “American Negro,” American historians had fallen far short of that ideal. Instead, they produced — for the consumption of both students and the general public — a history that cast Reconstruction as a “disgraceful attempt to subject white people to ignorant Negro rule.” Rather than treat history as “a science or as an art using the results of science,” they had used it as a tool of “pleasure and amusement, for inflating our national ego, and giving us a false but pleasurable sense of accomplishment.” This history, wrote Du Bois, existed only to “influence and educate the new generation along the way we wish,” where “we” meant the existing power structure."

How was it possible, Chesnutt wondered, that the same person could be classified as black in North Carolina but white in South Carolina? Even W. E. B. Du Bois had trouble formulating a theoretically accurate account of racial identity, so he put it simply: A black man is “a person who must ride ‘Jim Crow’ in Georgia.” But his statement still leaves us with a puzzle: What would a black man be without Jim Crow to define him?"

Abolition-democracy, Du Bois writes, was the “liberal movement among both laborers and small capitalists” who saw “the danger of slavery to both capital and labor.” Its standard-bearers were abolitionists like Wendell Phillips and radical antislavery politicians like Charles Sumner and Thaddeus Stevens, and in its eyes, “the only real object” of the Civil War was the abolition of slavery and “it was convinced that this could be thoroughly accomplished only if the emancipated Negroes became free citizens and voters.” It was also clear to some within abolition-democracy that “freedom in order to be free required a minimum of capital in addition to political rights.” In this way, abolition-democracy was an anticipation of social democratic ideology, although few of its proponents, in Du Bois’s view, grasped the full significance of their analysis of the relationship between political freedom, civil rights and economic security. Opposing abolition-democracy, in Du Bois’s telling, were the reactionaries of the former Confederate South who sought to “re-establish slavery by force.” The South, he writes, “opposed Negro education, opposed land and capital for Negroes, and violently and bitterly opposed any political power. It fought every conception inch by inch: no real emancipation, limited civil rights, no Negro schools, no votes for Negroes.” Between these two sides lay Northern industry and capital. It wanted profits and it would join whichever force enabled it to expand its power and reach. Initially, this meant abolition-democracy, as Northern industry feared the return of a South that might threaten its political and economic dominance. It “swung inevitably toward democracy” rather than allow the “continuation of Southern oligarchy,” Du Bois writes."

In 1926, The New York Times denied his request, as did most other newspapers. In 1929, when the editor for the Encyclopaedia Britannica informed Du Bois that Negro would be lowercased in the article he had submitted for publication, Du Bois quickly wrote a heated retort that called “the use of a small letter for the name of twelve million Americans and two hundred million human beings a personal insult.” The editor changed his mind and conceded to the capital N, as did many other mainstream publications including The Atlantic Monthly and, eventually, The New York Times.

I return to Du Bois, even as I read more recent work, because he offers a framework that is useful, I think, for analyzing the struggle for democracy in our own time. The central conceit of Du Bois’s landmark study — whose full title is “Black Reconstruction: An Essay Toward a History of the Part Which Black Folk Played in the Attempt to Reconstruct Democracy in America, 1860-1880” — is that the period was a grand struggle between “two theories of the future of America,” rooted in the relationship of American labor to American democracy. “What were to be the limits of democratic control in the United States?” Du Bois asks. “Was the rule of the mass of Americans to be unlimited, and the right to rule extended to all men regardless of race and color?” And if not, he continues, “How would property and privilege be protected?”"

Washington to have been a man of remarkable skill in dealing with white America.

Du Bois sums up Brown’s views in his conclusion. “John Brown loved his neighbor as himself,” writes Du Bois. “He could not endure therefore to see his neighbor poor, unfortunate or oppressed.” Brown’s sympathy with the least advantaged was strengthened by his Christianity and influenced by the “social doctrines of the French Revolution with its emphasis on freedom and power in political life.” Added to all of this, Du Bois writes, was Brown’s own “inchoate but growing belief in a more just and a more equal distribution of property.” From this, Brown concluded that “all men are created free and equal.” It is this point that Du Bois wields against the eugenicists and white supremacists of his time, the intellectual descendants of slaveholders who dominated the mainstream of American letters with arguments about the natural inferiority of nonwhites. “Has John Brown no message — no legacy, then, to the twentieth century?” asks Du Bois. “He has and it is this great word: the cost of liberty is less than the price of repression. The price of repressing the world’s darker races is shown in a moral retrogression and an economic waste unparalleled since the age of the African-slave trade.” (I quoted a version of this line in my column on Tuesday.) Viewed in this light, Du Bois says, the memory of John Brown stands as a “mighty warning” to the United States and its peers. To wait to rectify the sins of the present — to sidestep justice in favor of comfort — is to make the final price of liberty all the more expensive. John Brown “knew that in 1700 it would have cost something to overthrow slavery and establish liberty; and that by reason of cowardice and blindness the cost in 1800 was vastly larger but still not unpayable,” Du Bois writes. “He felt that by 1900 no human hand could pluck the vampire from the body of the land without doing the nation to death.” What Brown decided, Du Bois continues, was that he had to strike a blow for justice in his time. “It will cost something — even blood and suffering — but it will not cost as much as waiting.” Du Bois was very much a man of his time — Victorian, bourgeois and more than a little elitist. You can see these aspects of Du Bois in his Brown biography, and for a modern reader, they may be a little jarring. And yet, Du Bois’s broadside against hierarchy and exclusion still lands with as much force in 2022 as I’m sure it did in 1909. His warning that the tolerance of injustice will only lead to darker places and “darker deeds” is still relevant. And his closing reminder that without real “equality of opportunity” the best in humanity cannot be “discovered and conserved” remains as true now as it was then."

Du Bois, the leading scholar of the first half of the 20th century, defined the urgency of black social responsibility in his famous essay “The Talented Tenth” — 10 being the percentage of the African-American demographic needed to lead the race into an integrated, equal America. In “The Talented Tenth,” Du Bois called for “intelligent leadership” directed by “college-trained men” devoted to a “thorough understanding of the mass of Negroes and their problems” for the purpose of solving these problems, still so deeply entrenched a half century after the abolition of slavery. Forty-five years later, Du Bois would lament, this call had been largely ignored. He worried aloud about the growing class divide within Black America and how the consequences of that divide might affect the task of “lifting as we climb,” the motto of the National Association of Colored Women’s Clubs, describing the privilege and burden of the middle class to facilitate black upward mobility. Indeed, by 1948 Du Bois felt that the new black middle class had forgotten this noble calling. There had been, even during his college days at Fisk, troublesome warning signs: “sharp young persons, who received the education given very cheaply at Fisk University, with the distinct and single-minded idea, of seeing how much they could make out of it for themselves, and nobody else.” Du Bois knew, of course, that any black person at that time had to struggle to tear down barriers just to lift oneself and one’s family. But that was not enough: Successful black people, he said, must recognize that their place in life was merely a matter of opportunity. “If such opportunity were extended and broadened, a thousand times as many Negroes could join the ranks of the educated and able, instead of sinking into poverty, disease, and crime.” Du Bois also knew that Black America had never consisted of one social or economic class. Even before the outbreak of the Civil War, about 11 percent of Black America was free, some born into families that had been free for generations. And in 1899, when Du Bois published his seminal sociological study, “The Philadelphia Negro,” he was already noting that these two classes had morphed into four: the middle class and above, working people (“fair to comfortable”), the poor and, in terms his Victorian contemporaries would have approved of, the “vicious and criminal classes.” Du Bois would probably be astonished to see how these classes have fared, especially since the death of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, just as new affirmative action programs were beginning to expand drastically the ranks of black students on white campuses and thus to affect the class structure of Black America."

A study of corporate and political power elites, it is also a work of cultural criticism, an effort to supply Afro-American thought with a critical framework.

In the 1930's and 40's, Du Bois drifted away from the N.A.A.C.P., saying it had come to reflect middle-class values and was not helping the poorest blacks. In the 50's, Du Bois became increasingly critical of the United States, and in 1961, at the age of 93, he joined the Communist Party and moved to Ghana, where he died two years later. In response to criticism that the Postal Service should not honor a Communist, Donald McDowell, who heads the philatelic program, said in an interview with Linn's Stamp News, ""There was much more to Du Bois than that bitter chapter of his life.""

(Ages 12 to 16),https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/16/archives/cheer-the-lonesome-traveler.html,,,,,,,,,,"Saunders Redding once wrote that the publication‐of “The Souls of Black Folk” perhaps fixed “that moment in history when the American Negro be gan to reject the idea of the world's belonging to white people only.. to think of himself... as a potential force in the organization of society.” That statement not only describes the significance of W. E. B. Du Bois's most famous hook, it also pinpoints the author's contribution to America and the American black man. Sociologist, historian and civil rights leader, Dr. Du Bois was, for more than a half century, one of the most influential and controversial black men in America. Born in 1868, he left Harvard with a Ph.D. in 1892. For most of his remaining years in the United States (he went to Ghana in 1961), he led the Afro‐American's drive for equal participation in so ciety—and, while rejecting separa tism, insisted that black men should preserve their distinct cultural heri tage. He has been called the intellec tual forefather of black militancy and cultural self‐consciousness. In this brief, well‐written and sym pathetically drawn portrait, Leslie Lacy provides an enticing introduc tion to his subject's complex person ality and career; James Barkley's sen sitive illustrations and a fine bibliog raphy supplement the text. Perhaps due to Lacy's personal regard (the author met Du Bois in Accra, Ghana, in 1963, just prior to his death), this is more than a one‐dimensional paean or list of accomplishments. Du Bois also emerges as a vivid personality. In tracing his career, Lacy also provides an outline of the evolution of black protest in post‐Reconstruc tion America. Du Bois's ground‐break ing studies of Africa and of urban blacks; his organizing, in 1905, of the Niagara Movement (forerunner of the N.A.A.C.P., of which he was a founder); his theory of the Talented Tenth; his feud with Booker T. Wash ington and, later, Marcus Garvey; his founding of the Pan‐African Congress; his final disenchantment with the American system and his turn to so cialism—all these are milestones in the development of black America's present political posture. “Cheer the Lonesome Traveler” is an informative and balanced account of Du Bois's life—one that should stir the interest of all young readers, re gardless of their pigmentation."

197,222,11/4/84,Magazine,METROPOLIS OF THE MIND,https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/04/magazine/metropolis-of-the-mind.html,,,,,,,,,,"New York began its rise to intellectual primacy in the 1850's. It is easy now to forget that throughout the colonial era and the early 19th century, New York was at best the third city of the nation, behind Boston and Philadelphia. What shifted the gravity was the migration of the publishing industry to New York from Boston. Initially, the publishers were simply seeking more customers - New York had the largest population - but their relocation set off a chain reaction that deeply altered the city. With publishing houses came writers and editors and illustrators. Meanwhile, the city had begun to change in other ways. At the top of the New York economic scale, the captains of commerce and industry began to endow museums and to support individual artists; at the bottom, each wave of immigrants enriched and diversified the intellectual community. City College, established in 1849, acted as the great pedagogue for those without wealth and came to be known as ''the poor man's Harvard.'' As more creative people lived in New York, even more were drawn to it. Scale is the key word: The number of college graduates living in New York City today - 777,000 - collectively would constitute the 11th-largest city in the United States. With size comes sustenance for all sorts of specialized intellectual communities. Greenwich Village became an urban version of the artists' colony, a home to creators of all stripes, the neighborhood that gave Eugene O'Neill a stage in the 1920's (at the Provincetown Playhouse) and Bob Dylan a bandstand in the 1960's (at Folk City). Miles uptown, Harlem has been home in this century to a black intelligentsia that has included the writers Langston Hughes, James Weldon Johnson, James Baldwin and Ralph Ellison, the political theorist W. E. B. Du Bois, and the photographer James Van Der Zee, whose record of his era appeared decades later in the striking album ''Harlem on My Mind.''"
198,80,9/30/21,T Magazine,The Privilege of Mediocrity,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/30/t-magazine/mediocrity-people-of-color.html,,,,,,,,,,"In February 1926, the N.A.A.C.P. magazine The Crisis published a piece by its editor, W. E. B. Du Bois, under the headline “A Questionnaire.” Du Bois posed seven questions intended for artists — fiction writers, poets, painters and more — on how Black people should be portrayed in their work. The questions leave no doubt about where Du Bois himself stands. For instance, question six asks: “Is not the continual portrayal of the sordid, foolish and criminal among Negroes convincing the world that this and this alone is really and essentially Negroid, and preventing white artists from knowing any other types and preventing Black artists from daring to paint them?” Almost a quarter century earlier, Du Bois had popularized the concept of “the talented tenth,” his belief that “[t]he Negro race, like all races, is going to be saved by its exceptional men.” It was contingent, he argued, upon “the Best” of the race to “guide the Mass away from the contamination and death of the Worst.” His “Questionnaire” expanded this gospel of excellence into the imaginative realm, as well. Mediocrity or worse must be rooted out not only in life but in art. Later, in 1993, the historian Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham coined the phrase “politics of respectability” to describe a belief that individual moral and behavioral reform among Black Americans could counter pervasive racist images and perhaps even help fix the entire system of race inequality in the United States. In the years since, the concept of a politics of respectability has been adopted and adapted by other minority groups as a strategy for assimilation and advancement."

Handy, the “father of the blues,” in Memphis, and they formed the Pace & Handy Music Company, combining Pace’s business knowledge and Handy’s creative genius. In 1918, they moved Pace & Handy to the Gaiety Theater building on Broadway, which they promoted as the Home of the Blues and their company as the Leading Colored Music Publishers. In early 1921, Pace struck out on his own, taking most of the office staff with him to found Pace Phonograph Company — its first office was in his home on West 138th Street — and starting Black Swan Records. It was aimed at recording black performers at a time when many big record companies would not. Pace’s goal was to challenge white stereotypes by recording not just comic and blues songs, but also sacred and operatic music and serious ballads. Du Bois was one of Black Swan’s directors."

Franklin Frazier and W. E. B. Du Bois. The photograph, taken in 1942, is graphic evidence of how much Mr. Bond, 58, is steeped in the history of African Americans and the struggle for black advancement. His father, Horace Mann Bond, an educator who was president of Fort Valley State College and Lincoln University -- two historically black colleges -- knew Booker T. Washington, broke bread with Du Bois and helped write briefs for the landmark school desegregation case Brown v. Board of Education."
